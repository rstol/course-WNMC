# Chat app using arduino and VLC with LED's
## Start app
This code uses python3.

The serial com port (COMXX) may need to be modified.

### Run the script from two terminals (for two device system):
1. `python3 ./assignment05/chatApp.py`
2. Provide the device address for each device
3. The receiver port can be provider or the default "FF" will be used

## Notes
I couldn't run the script as I don't have the arduino connected. I hope the script works.
